PART 1 (5 points)

1.   Write a factorial calculator  that uses looping (a "for loop").

2.  The signature of the main method will be:

    def factorialI(n):


'''


'''create the factorialI function '''
def factorialI(n):
    '''create an object to set the beginning of the range to 1'''
    result = 1
    '''use a for loop to run the factorial 0 - n'''
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        '''return the product of an integer and all the integers below it'''
        result *= i
        '''return the result of the factorial loop'''
    return result


'''print the result'''
print (factorialI(6))

PART 2

1. Write a factorial calculator that uses recursion.

2.  Write a factorial calculator that uses recursion.

3.  The signature of the main method will be: def factorialR(n):

4.  The base case in the recursive function will be: if n == 1:  return 1


5.  And a return statement for the result of the non-base case, of course: return result


6.  Put in a print statement as the first line of the function:

    print("factorial has been called with n = " + str(n))


7.  Put in a print statement as the "last" line of the function, immediately before you return the result

    print("intermediate result for ", n, " * factorial(" ,n-1, "): ",res)


8.  Try factorial(4), and factorial(7) with the printing.

9.  Run the code for a number big enough to take  5 to 10 seconds to calculate.
    Disable the prints before running on big numbers!

PART 3 (7 points)

1.  Add the benchmarking code to your two programs.

2.  Run them both on the big number you used in part 2 (or such smaller number needed
    to get it to run in less than a few seconds). Disable print statements in the
    code-to-be-measured before benchmarking.

3.  Explain the difference in times between the iterative and the recursive code.

    #The reason for the difference in recursion vs iteration run times

    For the difference in times, the recursive code took longer to run than the
    iteration code. As the integer increases in size, the difference in run time
    grows bigger between iteration and recursion runs

    The difference between recursion and iteration is that recursion is a method call in "which the method
    being called is the same as the one making the call while iteration is when a loop is repeatedly
    executed until a certain condition is met."
    ("Iteration vs Recursion". Feb 25, 2018, https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/iteration-vs-recursion-c2017a483890)

    "A conditional statement decides the termination of recursion while a control variableâ€™s
    value decide the termination of the iteration statement. Infinite recursion can lead to
    system crash whereas, infinite iteration consumes CPU cycles."
    ("Iteration vs Recursion". Feb 25, 2018, https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/iteration-vs-recursion-c2017a483890)

     Recursion and iteration perform the same kinds of tasks. In Python, iterative functions can be changed to
     recursion because iteration is just a version of recursion known as tail recursion. "Recursion is usually slower
     and uses more memory because of the overhead of creating and maintaining stack frames. However,recursion is the
     better choice when exploring/manipulating recursive data structures like linked lists and trees or parsing
     expressions"
